    "VaR and ES are the two main metrics used in risk management. Value at Risk (VAR) is defined as the most amount of money you are willing to lose given a certain confidence interval and over a defined period of time. In other words, for a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability $p$, the $p$ VaR can be defined informally as the maximum possible loss during the time if we exclude worse outcomes whose probability is less than $p$. Expected Shortfall is defined as the average of all losses which are greater or equal than VaR, i.e. the average loss in the worst (1-$p$)% cases, where $p$ is the confidence level.\n",

    "Our portfolio VaR calculation model uses three different methods, which are Parametric VaR, historical VaR, and Monte Carlo VaR. As we know, there are difference assumptions and derivations, so each method has advantages and limitations. The advantage of this model is its portfolio flexibility since both stocks and options can be included in the portfolio. Additionally, there is no limitation on the long short positions of each element and also on the number of elements in a portfolio. Everyone can choose the best model based on different assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users have to understand the details of each VaR calculation method to select their ideal VaR Calculation method. For parametric VaR, the advantages are fast calculation and easy to understand. The major limitation is that when the actual distribution of portfolio value is not normal or the portfolio payoff is not linear, this method will not be accurate. When the actual distribution is fat-tailed, parametric VaR is underestimated. The advantage of historical VaR is that it does not have any assumption of distribution. When portfolio distribution is not normal and historical performance correctly predicts the future performance, the historical VaR will give accurate VaR estimation. However, historical VaR method requires a larger amount of data and the calculation time is longer than parametric VaR method. Lastly, the advantage of Monte Carlo VaR is its insensitivity to linearity. Therefore, it is useful when options are included in the portfolio. Nevertheless, computation speed of Monte Carlo VaR is very low because it needs to generate a large number of simulations. Additionally, the approximation of option VaR is also another limitation of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model do not hold, historical and Monte Carlo methods will not accurate estimate the option VaR. And due to delta approach in parametric VaR, if the underlying stock price changes by a large amount, estimation will be less accurate. This can be improved by applying the Taylors expansion in option VaR estimation."
